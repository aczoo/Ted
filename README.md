# Ted
The legal services market is one of the largest in the world and for a good reason; it is pertinent that every individual know their rights. Yet, the industry remains largely underdigitalized. This brings us to Ted, an app centered around a chat bot that helps users learn more about their constitution rights. Users can review recent legal news and talk to Ted about the different amendments, legal jargon, criminal law, and the effect of the coronavirus on their legal rights.
